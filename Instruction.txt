Once the Eclipse program is opened, the user should be able to see two project packages:
*TTC2014

Inside the TTC2014 package, there exists several document file:
	*src; it includes the output of the transformation both in Java and C# format
	*Models; it includes Models and Meta-models of the transformation
		-class.ecore
		-classes.emf
		-xml.ecore
		-xml.emf

	*Transformation; it consists of the following folders:
		-Java Transformation; which includes;
			#All the test cases
			#XMLtoClass; it is written in ETL and produces instances of the meta-model
			#GenerateMain.egl
			#JavaMainMethod.egl
			#JavaOneClass.egl
			#ToJava.egl
			#ToJavaDebug.egl
			#xml.build; by running this file, the transformation would produce the result only in Java format

		-CS Transformation; which includes;
			#All the test cases
			#XMLtoClass; it is written in ETL and produces instances of the meta-model
			#CSGenerateMain.egl
			#CSMainMethod.egl
			#CSOneClass.egl
			#CS.egl
			#ToCSDebug.egl
			#csxml.build; by running this file, the transformation would produce the result only in CSharp files

	*workflow; it consists of a single xml.build file that by running it, the transformation would produce results in all languages automatically
